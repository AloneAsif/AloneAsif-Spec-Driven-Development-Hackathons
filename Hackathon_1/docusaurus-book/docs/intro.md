# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book focuses on embodied intelligence, humanoid robotics, and AI systems that operate in the physical world.

## About This Book

This resource explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, with a particular emphasis on systems that interact with the physical environment. You'll learn about:

- The fundamentals of embodied intelligence and its applications
- Humanoid robot design, control, and development
- AI systems specifically designed for physical world interaction
- ROS 2 integration with AI agents for robotic control
- Simulation environments and real-world deployment strategies

## Getting Started

Begin your journey by exploring the modules that cover the fundamentals of ROS 2, simulation environments, AI for robotics, and humanoid systems.

## Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Start with our comprehensive ROS 2 educational module that covers everything you need to know about the Robot Operating System 2:

- [Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture](./module-1/intro-to-ros2.md) - Learn the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture including nodes, topics, services, and actions
- [ROS 2 Publishing and Subscribing](./module-1/ros2-pub-sub.md) - Master the publisher-subscriber pattern that forms the backbone of ROS 2 communication
- [Python AI Agent Integration](./module-1/ros2-python-agents.md) - Connect Python AI agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- [URDF Basics for Humanoids](./module-1/urdf-basics.md) - Create robot models with Unified Robot Description Format for humanoid robots
