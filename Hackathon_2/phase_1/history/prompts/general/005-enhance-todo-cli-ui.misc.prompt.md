Key recommendations include adding color-coded output, destructive operation confirmations, enhanced error messages with suggestions, and modern menu styling while maintaining CMD/PowerShell familiarity."
outcome: "Analysis complete with refactored menu.py code provided. User needs to approve implementation."
